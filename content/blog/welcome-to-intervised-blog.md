# Welcome to the Intervised Blog

We're excited to launch our blog ‚Äî a space where **vision meets execution**, where creativity and systems thinking converge to help you rise through resonance, clarity, and trust.

## What is Intervised?

**Intervised** = *"Mutually envisioned"*

We are a hybrid creative-tech studio serving as the **intercessor between vision and execution**. We act as a collaborative intelligence engine where creativity and systems thinking meet, helping creators, ministries, and brands bring their projects into form.

## The Content Development Lenses

When creating content, we use four powerful lenses:

1. **Moment Lens**: What moment made you feel something?
2. **Testimony Lens**: What story or lesson do we want to tell?
3. **Hook Lens**: How can we say this in one line that stops scrolling?
4. **Vision Lens**: Does this align with Intervised's bigger story?

Here you'll find:

- **Behind-the-scenes insights** from our creative and tech projects
